Place the gardena_smart.py in custom_components/sensor

Adjust the configuration, see sensors.yaml, binary_sensors.yaml and groups for tips.

You also need to install the gardena_smart python package. Hopefully this will install by itself, though i felt i needed to reboot home assistant multiple times.
