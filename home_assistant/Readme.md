Place the gardena_smart.py in custom_components/sensor

Adjust the configuration, see sensors.yaml, binary_sensors.yaml and groups for tips.

You also need to install the gardena_smart python package, i have not uploaded it to the python repository yet, as i want more feedback on how well this is working.

To install i cloned this repository and went into home assistant :

from the source folder :

  pip install . -t /config/deps/
